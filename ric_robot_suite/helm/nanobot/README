This directory contains a Helm chart for the minimal robot container
and Kubernetes job.

The job mounts its testsuites directory as a configmap, built from
files in nanobot/configmap-src/testsuites.  Template expansion is
performed on files in that directory.

Configuration of the chart is split between the "recipe" used to
deploy the RIC (and consumed by the ric-common chart, which is
required for this chart) and the chart's own values.yaml file.
Generally, RIC platform configuration is specified by the recipe, and
robot and xapp configuration from the chart's values.yaml, although
there is some overlap.

Support files (testsuites, keyword definition libraries, scripts, and
variable definition files) for the robot framework itself are supplied
by k8s configmaps generated from the contents of subdirectories of the
configmap-src directory; those subdirectories may contain one or more of
the following directories:

bin/:        scripts/binaries, mounted at /robot/bin
testsuites/: test suites, mounted at /robot/testsuites
properties/: variable definition (properties) files;
             contents mounted at /robot/resources
resources/:  robot keyword definition libraries, contents
             mounted at /robot/resources

Helm template expansion is performed on the contents of all
directories.
Because both resources/ and properties/ are mounted at
robot/resources, care should be taken to ensure that names do not
collide across those directories, particularly between trees.


To install the chart (which creates and runs a single Kubernetes job),
edit values.yaml to reflect your environment and desired tests and run

$ helm install [--values <override-file> ] --namespace <namespace> nanobot

... where <override-file> is the recipe override file used when
deploying the RIC, if any.

The namespace selected will be where the job's service account is
created and the job runs.  It may but need not be the same as the RIC
platform or xapp namespace â€”- the chart may be deployed in any
namespace.
